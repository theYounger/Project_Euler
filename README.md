### Problem 3: Find the Largest Prime Factor
####The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

####What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


The biggest challenge in Problem #3 was the impossibly enormous scope of the computing task, if such a challenge was to be tackled with the simple algorithmic methods of Problems #1 and #2.

First step was to break down the challenge into a manageable size.
